== Dependencies ==

CMake 3.24 or newer and a working C++20 compiler are the only dependencies.

== Building and running ==

Use `./scripts/test.sh` to build and run tests. This will install binaries to the repository's `bin` directory. You can then run using e.g. `./bin/mandelbrot`. This will write a Mandelbrot set to `testdata/current/mandelbrot.bmp`.
